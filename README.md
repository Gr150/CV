# YOLOv5/v7 bouning box and Empty Shelf Detection

This repository contains notebooks  for training and detecting empty shelves using YOLOv5 and YOLOv7 models. The "utils" directory includes utility scripts that might be helpful for your projects.

## Contents

- `utils/`: This directory contains utility scripts 

- `Yolo_v5_empty_shelf_detect.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating empty shelf detection using YOLOv5.

- `Yolo_v7_empty_shelf_detection.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating empty shelf detection using YOLOv7.

- `detect.py`: A script for object detection using YOLO models.

- `train.py`: A script for training YOLO models.

- `yolo_v5_final.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook showcasing the bounding box detection using YOLOv5 model.

- `yolov7.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook showcasing the bounding box detection using the YOLOv7 model.

## Usage


- Use `detect.py` to perform object detection using trained models.

- Use `train.py` to train your YOLO models based on your dataset.
